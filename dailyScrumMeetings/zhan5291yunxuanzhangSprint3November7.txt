What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Modified the CRC card because my team member has added some parent class to the command.
	- Added the docstring to each public static method.
	
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Make preparation to the next assignment.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- A little problem with my unit test.
