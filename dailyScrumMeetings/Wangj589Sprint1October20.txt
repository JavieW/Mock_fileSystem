What did I work on in the last three days?
	- finished the Cd class
	- finished a basic code for Jshell, StemFile, File, Directory and FileSystem
	
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Let more command classes get finished, 
	- Add more features for Jshell, StemFile, File, Directory and FileSystem

Am I blocked on anything?
	- A little bit confuse about the command with a path as a parameter
	- does the path "//a/b/c" allowed as there are 2(may be more) / stay together
