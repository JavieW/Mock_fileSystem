What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Discuss with team members about how to improve our basic code without overriding.
	- Check whether the comment of my cat class has some form problems.
	
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Improve comments in all files follow the correct form.
	- Finish Sprint2 ahead of time.
	
Am I blocked on anything?
	- I was a little confused about my part in Sprint2.
	(But I am going to discuss with my team members. Then we can clearly make decision on our each task).
